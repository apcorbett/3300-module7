        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          According to PEW Research<sup>1</sup>, 96% of adults between 18-29
          occasionally consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this
          mean that higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically,
          what do higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher
          ratings lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games
          with a dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than
          popular games with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether
          there has been an increase in the production of games in recent years
          and, if so, what effect this increase has on the quality of games
          based on review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number
          of games results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation
          of video game releases?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this project, I plan to use Metacritic's user and critic review
          scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game
          and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales
          data obtained from VGChartz.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="“data”">
        <h2>2. Data</h2>
        <p>
          This project uses two primary sources of data: Metacritic's<sup
            >2</sup
          >
          game critic and game player review scores of different games and
          VGChartz<sup>3</sup> data about video game sales.
        </p>
        <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
        <p>
          I collected data from Metacritic, which contained user (user score)
          and critic (meta score) review scores for each game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Metacritic's data was found on 186 different web pages. I wrote a web
          crawling script to collect all data across these 186 pages. I
          collected the game title, summary, platform, user score, meta score,
          and release date for 18,526 games. Some of the results were the same
          game that was released on different platforms, which is essential to
          consider when I begin merging the data. I created a data frame which
          is contained in the Metacritic.csv file in the project folder. The web
          crawling script that I wrote is contained in the metacritic.R file in
          the project folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data didn't need much cleaning; however, to make the platform
          match with the VGChartz data, I created a dictionary to convert
          Metacritic's platform data to match VGChartz. This cleaning was done
          in the file combining_vgs.R.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 Video Game Sales</h3>
        <p>
          The website VGChartz provides sales data about the number of units of
          each game/platform combination sold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information was contained in 1,249 web pages. Due to the extensive
          nature of the data, I decided to break the web crawling results into
          six different CSV files (VGChartz_0 - 5.csv), all contained in the
          project folder. The web crawling script is contained in the vgchartz.R
          file in the project folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          I collected the game, platform, release date, publisher, and sales
          data from PAL, Japan, and North America as well as total game sales
          for 62,398 games. Like the Metacritic data, some of these games were
          released on multiple platforms, which count as a unique observation in
          the data. Another interesting thing to note is that series were
          counted in this data frame alongside their individual counterparts.
          For example, Super Mario is counted as a series, but each entry in the
          series is also contained in the dataset. This was handled in the
          cleaning of the data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In cleaning the data, I merged all six VGChartz .csv files into one
          complete file using row bind to build a complete data frame. I also
          removed unnecessary columns, trimmed the white space on the title, and
          returned only the distinct values of the dataset. When I read the CSV
          into the script, I created NA values where data was missing. I also
          removed the game series by filtering them out during data cleaning.
          This cleaning was done in the file combining_vgs.R.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Combining Reviews and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          Since both data sets included the same game title multiple times based
          on the platform, I had to merge based on both the game title and
          platform. Both data sets are also vastly different in the number of
          observations. I decided to create two separate data sets in merging.
          One data set is the intersection of the data and only contains data
          that appears in both data sets. The other data set, called the union,
          contains all rows from both data sets. All this work was done in the
          combining_vgs.R file in the project folder. Next, I imported both data
          frames into the cleaning_vgs.R file in the project folder for further
          cleaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the differentiator between both data frames is their number of
          rows and most of my cleaning was regarding the columns, I created a
          function to iterate over both data sets to clean them. This cleaning
          included trimming the white space on the summary and publisher,
          turning the sales data into numeric, and adding the platform,
          publisher, and title as factors. I also turned all the release dates
          into a “Month, Year” format and combined the release date from
          VGChartz and Metacritic into one column. Next, I dropped all sales
          data except North America sales and total sales. I also dropped the
          extra release date column, and the index columns. I exported these
          datasets to VGSales_union.csv and VGSales_intersect.csv, respectively.
          The union had 68,288 observations, and the intersect had 12,288
          observations. A description of each variable is contained in Table 1.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Analysis</h2>
        <h3>3.1 Video Game Ratings and Sales</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to find out whether games with higher reviews sell more and
          to explore the relationship between different types of sales and
          review scores. I started by calculating correlation coefficients to
          examine the relationships between variables. There was a correlation
          coefficient of 0.954 between total sales and North American sales,
          showing an extremely strong correlation between these two variables.
          North American sales make up 48.7% of total sales, which largely
          explains this strong correlation.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the correlation between sales and review scores was very
          weak. The correlation coefficient between total sales and meta score
          was 0.248, and it was 0.102 between total sales and user score. While
          there was a moderate correlation between user score and meta score at
          0.524, it was nowhere near as strong as the correlation between the
          two sales variables.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src=" images/1-scores_boxplot.png"
            alt="Boxplots comparing meta score
            and user score"
          />

            alt="Histograms comparing meta score
            and user score"
          />
          <figcaption>Figure 2 Review Score Histograms</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I initially thought this weaker correlation might be due to
          differences in rating scales between the two groups. To confirm this
          was not the case, I created a boxplot of the two scores using ggplot.
          This plot is shown in Figure 1. Although there may be slight
          differences in the interquartile range, the medians of the two
          variables are the same. The difference between their means is 1.67,
          which is somewhat significant. A histogram comparing the two
          variables, as shown in Figure 2, provides insight into the reason
          behind this difference. The meta scores have higher counts of positive
          reviews, while user scores show more low reviews. This likely
          contributes to why the meta score correlates slightly better with
          sales than the user score.
        </p>
        <p>
          The meta score is a better predictor of sales than the user score.
          While the correlation isn't very strong, it does exist. Many companies
          send out review copies to critics in hopes that reviews will boost
          sales. Critics usually publish their review scores in the days before
          a game is released, increasing excitement and benefiting both the
          video game company and the critic.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the correlation suggests there may not be as much benefit in
          this manufacturer-critic relationship as companies might hope. I
          initially suspected the weak correlation might be due to a large
          number of games with minimal sales. After recalculating the
          correlation coefficient between meta score and total sales, the result
          was an even lower value of 0.065. While high review scores may help a
          company's reputation, they do not strongly correlate with higher
          sales.
        </p>
        <h3>3.2 Video Game Publishers</h3>
        <p>
          To identify which video game publishers have the highest sales, I
          created a summary data frame (publisher_df) grouped by publisher. In
          this data frame, I included the average ratings, total sales, and the
          number of games released by each publisher. To find the publishers
          with the highest sales, I used a slice_maxon the total sales column.
          The results appear in Table 2, and the data is saved in
          publisher_sales.csv within the project folder.
        </p>
        <h3>Table 2: Slice Max Summary</h3>
        <p>
          I noticed that all but one publisher released at least 800 games. I
          calculated the correlation between total sales and the number of games
          a publisher released. The correlation coefficient of 0.715 shows a
          strong relationship between the number of games released and total
          sales. To visualize this, I created a scatterplot between the two
          variables, shown in Figure 3.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src=" images/3-total_sales_number_games_released.jpg"
            alt="Scatterplot of number of games
            released and total sales"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 3 Scatterplot of the number of games by a publisher and their
            total sales
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This correlation does not apply to the number of games released and
          the publisher's average meta score. The correlation coefficient
          between these two variables was -0.013, showing no meaningful
          relationship between the number of games released and average meta
          score.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the strong correlation between the number of games and total
          sales, we can infer that a publisher's average meta score does not
          significantly affect its total sales. When comparing the overall
          average meta score of 71.145 to the values in Table 2, about 30% of
          publishers in Table 2 fall below this average. This further supports
          that meta scores and sales are not strongly correlated. This pattern
          is also visible in Figure 4, a scatterplot comparing the number of
          games released and meta score.

            Meta Score"

        <p>
          I then compared the top ten game publishers by North American sales
          and by total sales over the past ten years. I wanted to see if the
          same publishers appeared in both lists and whether regional
          differences influenced their rankings. The same publishers appeared in
          both lists but in slightly different orders. Total sales ranged from
          about 260 million to 1.9 billion games, with North American sales
          accounting for roughly 40-60% of the total. Details can be found in
          the top_10_NA and top_10_total data frames. The top ten publishers
          appear in Table 3.
        </p>
        <h3>Table 3: Top Publishers by North American Sales vs. Total Sales</h3>
        <h3>3.3 Release Date</h3>
        <p>
          To determine how sales, the number of games released, and review
          scores have changed over time, I created a data frame (by_month) that
          grouped games by month and calculated the average review scores, total
          sales, and number of games released. To simplify plotting, I converted
          the release dates into a standard date format by setting the day value
          to the first day of each release month.
        </p>
        <p>
          To start my analysis, I wanted to see if the number of games developed
          has increased over time. The correlation coefficient between release
          date and number of games released was 0.533, indicating a moderate
          relationship. I then plotted the number of games released over time
          and compared it to total game sales using the patchwork package. The
          scatterplot is shown in Figure 5.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/5-number_of_games_released_and_total_sales_by_month.png"
            alt="Scatterplots of Number of games
            and total sales by release date"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Figure 5 Number of Games Released and Total Sales by Month
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The point at the end should be ignored, as it includes two games yet
          to be released. The outlier in 2020 should also be disregarded because
          many games were misclassified to that date by the websites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Figure 5 shows a large peak in game releases around 2010, followed by
          a decline. Game sales, however, did not follow the same spike. Sales
          after 2010 remained relatively consistent. The rise in releases during
          the late 2000s was likely due to the introduction of new video game
          consoles that became popular in mainstream markets. Many of these
          consoles also played Blu-ray discs and had multimedia capabilities,
          which increased their appeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To further analyze sales, I examined how time has affected global and
          North American sales. The correlation coefficient between total sales
          and release date was 0.273—much lower than the correlation between
          release date and number of games released. Similarly, the correlation
          between North American sales and release date was 0.229. Figure 6
          compares sales trends to release dates.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/6-total_sales_by_release_date.jpg"
            alt="Scatter plot of North-American and Total Sales by

          />
          <figcaption>Figure 6 Total Sales by Release Date</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The trend of frequent outliers appears more prominent in total sales
          than in North American sales. Using slice_max on both total and North
          American sales reveals that these spikes are largely due to increased
          sales during the holiday season. The top ten sales months for both
          variables are October and November. Many publishers now time their
          releases during these months to take advantage of this trend. While
          sales increased throughout the 2000s, review scores did not follow the
          same pattern.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img

          />
          <figcaption>Figure 7 Review Scores by Release Date</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Figure 7 shows that review scores dropped sharply beginning in 2000.
          Meta scores declined much more dramatically than user scores during
          this period. Around 2010, meta scores began to rise again, while user
          scores continued to decline. This is reflected in the correlation
          coefficients: meta score has a correlation of -0.325 with release
          date, while user score has a correlation of -0.837. The divergence in
          score trends after 2010 partially explains the stronger correlation
          between meta score and total game sales.

        <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I analyzed three aspects of video game sales: the
          publisher, the release date, and how a game's sales and review scores
          influence each other. In summary, from the analysis questions
          presented in my proposal, I found the following results.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Is there a strong correlation between a game's review score and its
          sales? Is the meta score or the user score a better predictor of a
          game's sales?
        </p>
        <p>
          There is limited correlation between review scores and sales. But
          while the correlation isn't very strong, it does appear meta score is
          a better predictor of sales than the user score.
        </p>
        <p>2. Have the total sales of games seen an increase over the years?</p>
        <p>
          There is some correlation between release date and number of games
          released, but it is not especially strong. There was a peak in the
          number of games released around 2010 but since there has been a
          decline.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Which publishers have had the highest sales over the past ten
          years? Is there a difference between those with high sales in North
          America and those with high total sales?
        </p>
        <p>
          The top ten publishers are listed above in Table 3. The same ten
          publishers are present in both total sales and North American sales,
          just in a different order. Nintendo is solidly in first place with 1.9
          billion games sold followed by Activision at number two with 727
          million units sold. North American sales accounts for 40 - 60% of
          total sales making this region a significant contributor to sales
          success for game publishers.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Is the console on which a game is released strongly correlated to
          its ratings? Specifically, are there certain video game consoles that
          have the highest average ratings of games?
        </p>
        <p>
          The variables needed to answer this question were not present in the
          collected data. As noted below, this question would be an opportunity
          for further work on this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project has several limitations, including the lack of review
          scores for games released before the mid-90s, the improper release
          dates of some games, and the lack of information about the video game
          consoles. Future work on this project could include finding more
          sources to create a more complete dataset, analyzing the purchase of
          different video game consoles to see if the spikes in new video game
